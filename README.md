COSC3117-Artificial Intelligence @ Algoma Univeristy | Assignment 2 - Java Expert System

Project #2

Project description:
Design and implement an expert system using CLIPS/JESS or any programming language you prefer. You can choose any area in which you 
consider yourself to be an expert to design this system. If you have difficulty choosing an area, here is one suggestion:

Course Advising System: determines which courses an Algoma University computer science student should take. You can extract the knowledge 
required from the university course calendar. The system should prompt the user for information such as their intended degree, their year 
in the program, and the courses they have taken. The advice given would be in the form of suggested computer science courses to take.
Submit a report of a description of the problem domain including a complete list of rules about the expert system you built and attach 
screen shots of the execution of your program to prove it works. Your expert system should have at least 20 rules.

Please upload your report and all your source code to the CMS before November 7, 2017, 11:55pm. The TA will read your report and post the
marks and comments on the CMS.
